# ultimate-tic-tac-toe
This repository contains `3` tic tac toe projects. 

- **Tic tac toe blockchain** - uses a blockchain to store game states and cryptography to authenticate players. Uses the cosmos SDK and tendermint consensus. 
- **Tic tac toe arcade** - a pygame implementation of tic tac toe with an arcade-game UX. 
- **Unbeatable tic tac toe** - a command line game where you're up against the machine. This script will never lose a game of tic tac toe. 

Each folder has its own README file.
