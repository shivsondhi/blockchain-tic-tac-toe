# Unbeatable tic tac toe in C 

## Background 
Tic tac toe is a simple strategy game and if a player knows the right moves to play they can ensure that the worst they do is a draw. The starter has an advantage - if both players play all the right moves, the best the opponent can do is draw. 

## Implementation
The script first makes you choose the difficulty level. The easy option works by randomly picking moves and the hard version plays based on the user's moves. You can choose your shape and whether you want to start or not. In hard mode, the script plays the best moves and its best and worst possible results are win or draw. A player can play moves using the move chart provided in the command line, and can play multiple games back to back. A little delay is used in-between moves to pretend that the machine is deciding its thinking of its next move. The script can be compiled in a Windows or Linux environment.
